# Star Dweller üöÄ

Star Dweller is a space-themed personal dashboard app designed to keep you productive while keeping up with everything cosmic. Built with a mobile-first approach, it features widgets such as a To-Do list, Space News, SpaceX launch dates, all styled with a sleek night-sky palette. This project challenges me to continue learning new technologies (Jest, TypeScript) on the fly while leveraging my existing skills, aiming to create a standout portfolio piece for my developer journey.
