# Cosmic Dashboard üöÄ

Cosmic Dashboard is a space-themed personal dashboard app designed to explore the cosmos while boosting productivity. Built with a mobile-first approach, it features widgets like a To-Do list, Space News, SpaceX launch dates, all styled with a sleek Cosmic Dark palette. This project challenges me to learn new technologies (Jest, TypeScript) on the fly while leveraging my existing skills, aiming to create a standout portfolio piece for my journey as a developer.
